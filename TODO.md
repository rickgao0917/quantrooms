## Questions for Clarification:

1. **Target Users**: Who is the primary audience (students, professionals, competitive programmers)?

2. **QuantGuide Integration**: Do you have access to QuantGuide.io's API or will this be purely client-side injection?

3. **Scope**: Should this support all QuantGuide features or focus on specific problem types?

4. **Monetization**: Will this be free, freemium, or paid? This affects infrastructure planning.

5. **Platform Priority**: Chrome extension only, or should we plan for other browsers?

6. **Real-time Requirements**: How important is sub-second synchronization vs. eventual consistency?
